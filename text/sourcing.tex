\section{Sourcing Optimizations}
In order to source these optimizations, we looked towards two sources to determine available optimizations.
However, some optiiizimiations may not be applicable to a causal-block diagram, and of these, some may not be suitable to be done using transformations. For instance, . Also, the list of optimizations available is not complete.

\subsection{Code Compilers}
Code compilers have a number of analyses and procedures to increase a program's performance. Therefore, we examined a number of sources to gather a list of compiler optimizations. These include the constant folding and algebraic simplification optimizations.


\subsection{Simulink Optimizations}
Another source of optimizations was found by examining the Simulink documentation. One part was the optimizations done in code generation. For these, an example model and text described the procedure and benefit of the optimization. Another useful list of optimizations came from the Simulink model-checker. This model-checker highlights possible issues with the model and suggests fixes. We identified a number of these checks to be encoded as a transformation and fit within our framework.
