\section{Motivation}
Our motivation for this work is to explicitly define optimizations and apply them to models. The advantage of creating optimized models instead of only producing optimized code is that the modeller can then visually see the differences and changes in the model. Even with the traceability links in the Simulink generated code, it can still be difficult to precisely determine which elements in the model a given line of code represents. This model-o-model optimizaion adds extra traceability information where the optimizations are seen in the ssame modeling foramalism.


As well making optimizations to the model removes burden on the target compiler. Optimizations may now be done with more information and structure, and will be applicable to all targets.
